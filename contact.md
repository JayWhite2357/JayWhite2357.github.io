For students, the best way to contact me is through Canvas. You can find links on the [relevant course page](/all-courses/). If that doesn't work, you can email me.

For everyone else, the best way to contact me is via email. My email is jay dot white at uky dot edu.[^1]

[^1]: I use `at` and `dot` instead of `@` and `.` because posting my email verbatim result in a ton of spam emails.
