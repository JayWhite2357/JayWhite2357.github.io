AutoCompileLaTeX is a template repository that uses GitHub Actions to automatically compile *.tex files. Anyone can easily copy it.
I use it a lot for my personal courses, and find it helpful for collaborating with co-teachers who know how to use git.
I also like using github for version control of any of my living documents, and this allows me to view the documents as pdfs from any device in the world.
The link to the repository is [https://github.com/JayWhite2357/AutoCompileLaTeX](https://github.com/JayWhite2357/AutoCompileLaTeX).
