I have created a package for Macaulay2. I have submitted it to JSAG, and it will hopefully soon be in the Macaulay2 distribution itself.
The package is [here](https://jaywhite2357.github.io/MaxBettiNumbers/MaxBettiNumbers.m2), the documentation is [here](https://jaywhite2357.github.io/MaxBettiNumbers/), and the GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/JayWhite2357/MaxBettiNumbers).
