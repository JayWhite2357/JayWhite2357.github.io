Macaulay2 is a software system for research in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. MaxBettiNumbers is a package designed for Macaulay2 that contains methods to find maximum Betti numbers given bounds on the Hilbert function. The method `maxBettiNumbers` is the headliner in this package. It returns upper bounds for the total Betti numbers in a family that has bounds on the Hilbert function and/or the Hilbert difference function.\
The package is [here](https://jaywhite2357.github.io/MaxBettiNumbers/MaxBettiNumbers.m2), the documentation is [here](https://jaywhite2357.github.io/MaxBettiNumbers/), and the GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/JayWhite2357/MaxBettiNumbers).
