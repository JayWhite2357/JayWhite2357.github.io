My university uses WeBWorK and Canvas, and it is tedious to get the two to work smoothly together. To that end, I have created some small HTML apps to automate the process for me.
The main page for this is [here](https://jaywhite2357.github.io/WeBWorK2Canvas/). The source code for it is [here](https://github.com/JayWhite2357/WeBWorK2Canvas/).
