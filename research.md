My interests are in the area of commutative algebra. On part of this is that I am interested in writing code and packages for Macaulay2, a piece of software useful for computations in algebra.

For my thesis, I am working on finding bounds for Betti numbers of an ideal when fixing certain information about the Hilbert function. One aspect of this is a Macaulay2 package that finds ideals that give maximal Betti numbers from certain bounds on the Hilbert function.
