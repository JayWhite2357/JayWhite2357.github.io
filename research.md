My interests are in the area of commutative algebra. I am specifically interested in studying free resolutions.

For my thesis, I am studying under Uwe Nagel and am working on finding bounds for Betti numbers of an ideal when certain information about the Hilbert function is fixed. One aspect of this is developing the Macaulay2 package ["MaxBettiNumbers"](https://github.com/JayWhite2357/MaxBettiNumbersProject).
